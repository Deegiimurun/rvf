- Accessing `defaultValues`/`fieldErrors`/`touchedFields` from form context
- `disableFocusOnError` option
- Add a `disableNativeValidation` option
- Hooking into server-side validation
- Hooking into `setFormDefaults` (or removing it)
- Types of the `ref` for `getInputProps` doesn't seem right
- Way to get the name from `useField` and `useFieldArray`
- auto-add form id in `getInputProps` if it's passed as on option
  - (also give a default form id?)
- `ValidatorData` type
