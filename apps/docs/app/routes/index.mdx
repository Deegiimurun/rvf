# Remix Validated Form

A form library purpose-built for [Remix](https://remix.run) to make validation easy.

- Client-side, field-by-field and form-level validation
- Re-use validation on the server
- Set default values for the entire form in one place
- Supports nested objects and arrays
- Easily detect if a specific form is being sumitted
- Validation library agnostic
- Can work without JS
