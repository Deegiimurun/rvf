# Working with different input types

Since RVF validates and submits data directly from the html `form` element by default,
nearly anything you can do with plain html forms can be done with RVF.
All native input types are supported out of the box.

When you're using RVF to observe or set the value of a field,
it should hopefully "just work" the way you expect.
But for completeness, this page is going to cover all the different input types
and how they interact with RVF.

## Common traits

### Setting default values

All input types (except for `file`) can have their default value set using a `string`.
For input types that represent some other type (like `number`),
you can usually set the default value using that type.

### Observing / setting values

The type of the value you get when you call `form.value(fieldName)` is always
the same as the type you pass into `defaultValues`.
You should use the same type when calling `form.setValue(fieldName, value)`.

### Validating

Unless you're using [state mode](/state-mode), the data received by your validator
will _always_ be a `string` (except for `file` inputs) **OR** a `string[]`.

- If only one input is in the form for a given field, the value will be a `string`.
- If multiple inputs in the form have the same name, the value will be a `string[]`.

## Number inputs

### Setting default values

<Row>
  <Col>
    - Number inputs can be set using either a `number` or a `string`,
    and both approaches can be used for different fields in the same form.
    - When you access the value of the input using `form.value("age")`, the type
    of that value will be consistent with the type of the default value, even after
    the user has changed the value.
    - If there is no default value, the type of the value will be a `number`.
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ```tsx
    const form = useForm({
      defaultValues: {
        age: "25",
        numberOfPeople: 10,
      },
    })

    const age = form.value("age");
    //    ^? string
    const numberOfPeople = form.value("numberOfPeople");
    //    ^? number
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>

### Validating

Like most input types, the value inside the native `form` element is always a string.
Unless you're using [state mode](/state-mode), your validator should be able to handle that.

- If you're using `zod`, you can use `z.coerce.number` to handle this.
- If you're using `yup`, then `yup.number()` already handles this.

If you're using state mode, then the value passed to your validator will be the same value
that you would get out of `form.value("myField")`.

## File inputs

<Row>
  <Col>
    File inputs actually pretty inflexible. Try running this code to see what happens.
    If you do that, you might see an error like this:
    
    > This input element accepts a filename, which may only be programmatically set to the empty string.
  </Col>
  <Col>

    ```tsx
    const FileInputTest = () => {
      const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
      return <input type="file" defaultValue="myFile.txt" />;
    }
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>

Unfortunately, this means we can't set the default value of a file input
or modify it with `setValue`, unless that value is an empty string (`""`).
