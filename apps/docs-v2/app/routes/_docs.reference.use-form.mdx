# `useForm`

`useForm` is the main hook that you'll use to interact with RVF.
It accepts a `FormOpts` object you use to configure the form (see below),
and returns a `FormApi` object that you can use to interact with the form (see [FormApi](/reference/form-api)).

### Type

```tsx
function useForm<
  FormInputData extends FieldValues,
  FormOutputData,
  SubmitResponseData,
>(
  options: FormOpts<FormInputData, FormOutputData, SubmitResponseData>,
): FormApi<FormInputData>;
```

### Usage

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: { foo: "bar" },
  validator: myValidator,
  handleSubmit: (validatedData) => console.log(validatedData),
});
```

## `FormOpts`

### `defaultValues`

Sets the default values of the form.

For Typescript users, `defaultValues` is one of the most important props you'll use.
The type of the object you pass here, will determine the type of the data you get
when interacting with the form. For example, `form.value('myField')` will be typed based on
the type of `defaultValues.myField`.

It's recommended that you provide a default value for every field in the form.

### `validator`

A validator object created by a validation adapter such a `withZod` or `withYup`.
See [these docs](https://rvf-js.io/validation-library-support) for more details
and information on how to create a validator for other validation libraries.

### `submitSource`

Configures what RVF uses as the source of truth for form validation submission.
By default, this is set to `"dom"`, which means RVF will pull data directly out of the HTML form element.
If you set this to `"state"`, RVF will use the data stored in the form state as the source of truth.
You can read more about state mode [here](/state-mode).
