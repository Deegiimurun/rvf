# Scoping for powerful abstractions

A core feature (and one of the most powerful features) of RVF is the ability to scope your form
down to just one part of your data.
This gives us the ability to create flexible abstractions for whole subforms or even just a single field.

## Subforms

To demonstrate this, let's create a simple form for entering people's names
and ages. If you want to skip to the final code, go ahead and check out the
code in this demo.

<ScopingNameForm />
