# A simple form

Let's start with a simple form that uses only the native form APIs
to see how we can easily start enhancing it with RVF.

<SimpleForm />

Notice how much code we have to write just to:

- Pull all the data out of the form
- Validate that the passwords match
- Show a loading state

Now let's add just a little bit of RVF.

<SimpleFormRvf />
