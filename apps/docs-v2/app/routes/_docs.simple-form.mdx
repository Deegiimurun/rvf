# A simple form

Let's start with a simple form that uses only the native form APIs
to see how we can easily start enhancing it with RVF.

<SimpleForm />

Notice how much we have to:

- Manually pull all the data out of the form
- Manually validate that the passwords match in three different places
- Manually manage a loading state

## Simplifying with RVF

Now let's add just a little bit of RVF.

<SimpleFormRvf />
