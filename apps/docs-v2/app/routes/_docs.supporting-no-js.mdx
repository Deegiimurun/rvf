# Supporting users without JS

If you're using a server-side framework like Remix, you can use RVF even if JS is disabled in the user's browser.
However, the way you go about doing this may vary depending on how important this is to you.

## If supporting users without JS is important for you

You should fall back to [native browser validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
when JS is disabled. This is more work to maintain, but it's a better experience for users.

In order to do this properly, you can pass `noValidate` to your form when JS is available.
A helpful tool for doing that is [useHydrated from remix-utils](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-utils#usehydrated).
If you aren't using remix, you can copy the recipe [here](/recipes/use-hydrated).

This will allow RVF to take over validation when it can,
but will fall back to native browser validation when it can't.

If the native HTML api can't handle all of your validation requirements, you'll also want to read the next section.
